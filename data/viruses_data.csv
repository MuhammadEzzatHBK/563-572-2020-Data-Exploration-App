"1","BLV","Non-Human Pathogenic","Bluetongue disease is a noncontagious, insect-borne, viral disease of ruminants, mainly sheep and less frequently cattle, yaks, goats, buffalo, deer, dromedaries, and antelope. It is caused by Bluetongue virus. The virus is transmitted by the midges Culicoides imicola, Culicoides variipennis, and other culicoids."
"2","CVV","Huamn Pathogenic","Cache Valley orthobunyavirus is a member of the order Bunyavirales, genus Orthobunyavirus, and serogroup Bunyamwera, which was first isolated in 1956 from Culiseta inornata mosquitos collected in Utah's Cache Valley."
"3","MVM","Non-Human Pathogenic","Minute virus of mice (MVM) is a small (5-kb) single-stranded DNA virus. The prototypic strain is designated MVMp."
"4","Vesivirus 2117","Non-Human Pathogenic","Vesivirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Caliciviridae. Swine, sea mammals, and felines serve as natural hosts."
"5","Herpesvirus","Huamn Pathogenic","Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses that cause infections and certain diseases in animals, including humans. The members of this family are also known as herpesviruses."
"6","Human adenovirus type 1","Huamn Pathogenic","Has a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (known as the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system."
"7","Parainfluenza virus type 3","Huamn Pathogenic","Is one of a group of common viruses known as human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) that cause a variety of respiratory illnesses."
"8","Reovirus type 3","Huamn Pathogenic","Is a wild-type double-stranded RNA virus that is ubiquitous and pathogenic in humans."
"9","Simian adenovirus","Non-Human Pathogenic","Are members of the Adenoviridae family and the Mastadenovirus genus. In general adenoviruses have narrow host ranges, but in some cases closely related species may be infected. More than 50 serotypes have been isolated from NHP species"
"10","EHDV","Non-Human Pathogenic","A species of the genus Orbivirus, a member of the family Reoviridae. It is the causative agent of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, an acute, infectious, and often fatal disease of wild ruminants."
"11","PCV-1","Non-Human Pathogenic","Small, circular virus composed of a single strand of DNA. PCV-1 is found commonly among pigs, but is not known to cause disease in pigs nor other animals, including humans."
