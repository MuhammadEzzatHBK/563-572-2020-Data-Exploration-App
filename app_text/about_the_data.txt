Data was collected manually from table snippets & graphs provided in the article. Our records were revised, you can find the raw data provided in the 'data' subdirectory of the reporository but the file name '563–572 (2020) Dataset.xlsx'.
The authors gathered their dataset [that we obtained manually] from the CAACB organization, a biopharmaceutical industry consortium including more than 20 biotechnology companies housed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Biomedical Innovation. They collected comprehensive data on virus contaminations in cell culture operations from CAACB member companies.
These data were consolidated with information from published reports of virus contamination events. To our knowledge, this is the only comprehensive dataset available on adventitious virus contaminations of mammalian cell culture in the biotech industry.
Which means that this app probably explores all of the available data on our topic of intrest. We hope that it was up to the standards.
